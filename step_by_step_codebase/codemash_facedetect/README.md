# Step by Step Codebase for the Precompiler Session

This is the 'working' codebase for the precompiler session.

## How to use this codebase

In the precompiler session, there are steps where code is added to the project. This repo contains directories  corresponding to these steps (look in the 'step_by_step_code' directory). In each directory is code associated with the completed code for that step.

Where it makes sense, the completed code is only a snippet of the code needed.
