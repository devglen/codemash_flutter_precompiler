#Step by Step Codebase for the Precompiler Session

This is the 'working' codebase for the precompiler session.

## How to use this codebase

In the precompiler session, there are steps where code is added to the project. This repo contains directories ('Step 1', 'Step 2', etc.) corresponding to these steps with the associated completed code for that step.

Where it makes sense, the completed code is only a snippet of the code needed.
