## Pre-requisites for the Codemash Precompiler session - Bringing ML to Mobile Apps - Let's build an app to perform Face Recognition using Flutter

Flutter is Google's cross-platform development framework for quickly crafting high-quality native apps on Web, iOS, Android and ChromeOS in record time. During this session we will be covering what Flutter is, and how to develop using it. The good news - no experience with Flutter is needed for this session. 
 
Follow the steps below to prepare for this session at Codemash 2020.

1. **Install the Flutter SDK.** 
The Flutter documentation is excellent and has detailed instructions for installation on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Follow the documentation [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install Flutter on your computer.  

2. **Sign up for free Firebase Account**
As part of the session, the app we will be building with require a Firebase account to take advantage of the Firebase services used in the Firebase MLKit Vision Library. You can sign up for a Firebase account [here](https://firebase.google.com/).

2. **Take a quick look at the Firebase MLKit Vision Documentation**
We will be covering how to use the Firebase MLKit Vision library during the session. To get an idea of how powerful the Firebase MLKit Vision library check out the documentation [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit).

Amazing! You are all set and ready for the precompiler!
